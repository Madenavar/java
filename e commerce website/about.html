    <p>There are four main components to an About Us page:

        1. Share the story of why the company was founded
        
        This is your chance to focus on your company’s “why.” It could be what sets you apart from other competitors on the market.
        
        Share the moment you gained the inspiration for your business and what motivated you to start it.
        
        2. Highlight your background and your founding team’s role
        
        Who are you? Why are you the right person to lead your company at this time? Share your background and personal story. That’ll connect you to your customers.
        
        3. Document the evolution of the company
        
        State everything from the obstacles to the product enhancements. Bring your new customers up to speed. Where is the company today? How is it different from where it was before?
        
        4. Document the mission and vision
        
        What is your company trying to solve? Where is it going? End the About Us page by detailing the steps you’re taking to transform the business into your ultimate vision.
        
        With these four components, you’ll create a stellar About Us page that will wow prospects and convert new customers.
        
        Combining these elements with the right website builder and proper page design will help you transform a visitor into a customer.
        
        It’s important to remember what your customers want, too.
        
        Users in your target audience want to see your mission statement, social proof, and an example of using your product. These elements on your About Us web page will build trust with the target audience.
        
        Now, let’s look at some companies that championed those components and brought them to life.</p>
